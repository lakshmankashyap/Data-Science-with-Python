# Modeling and Estimation

### What is a model?
- A model is an idealized representation of a system. 
- For eg, if we drop a steel ball off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a simple model of gravity states that we expect the ball to drop to the ground, accelerating at the rate of 9.8 m/sÂ². This model also allows us to predict how long it will take the ball to hit the ground using the laws of projectile motion.
