## Granularity:

The granularity of your data is what each record in your data represents. It determines what kind of analyses you can perform. Generally speaking, too fine of a granularity is better than too coarse; while we can use grouping and pivoting to change a fine granularity to a coarse one, we have few tools to go from coarse to fine.
