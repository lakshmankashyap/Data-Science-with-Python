Data science lifecycle:-

## Stage 1

1. Question/Problem Formulation:
   * What do we want to know or what problems are we trying to solve?
   * What are our hypotheses?
   * What are our metrics of success?

## Stage 2

1. Data Acquisition and Cleaning:
   * What data do we have and what data do we need?
   * How will we collect more data?
   * Is our data representative?
   * How do we organize the data for analysis?

## Stage 3

1. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   * How is our data organized and what does it contain?
   * What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?
   * How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?
   
## Stage 4

1. Prediction and Inference:
   * What does the data say about the world?
   * Does it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?
   * How robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions?
