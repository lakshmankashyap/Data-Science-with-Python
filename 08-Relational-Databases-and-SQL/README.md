# Relational Databases and SQL:

A database is an organized collection of data. In the past, data was stored in specialized data structures that were designed for specific tasks. 

For example, airlines might record flight bookings in a different format than a bank managing an account ledger. In 1969, Ted Codd introduced the relational model as a general method of storing data. Data is stored in two-dimensional tables called relations, consisting of individual observations in each row (commonly referred to as tuples). Each tuple is a structured data item that represents the relationship between certain attributes (columns). Each attribute of a relation has a name and data type.

A relation's schema contains its column names, data types, and constraints. Two or more tables form a relational database, which is a collection of one or more relations.
