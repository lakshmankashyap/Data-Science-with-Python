# Visualization Principles

There are general principles that make visualizations much more effective at showing trends in the data. And the most important  principles are: scale, conditioning, perception, transformation, context, and smoothing.

## Principle of Scale:
- Principles of scale relate to the choice of x and y-axis used to plot the data. 
- When we select the x and y-axis for our plot, we should keep a consistent scale across the entire axis. 
- When selecting the x and y-axis limits we prefer to focus on the region with the bulk of the data, especially when working with long-tailed data.
